# Flappy Bird Game and Neataptic.js Models

## Flappy Bird Game

I have created a Flappy Bird game using JavaScript. The game is inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them. The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or falls to the ground. The player's score increases as the bird successfully passes through the pipes.

## Neataptic.js Models

In addition to the Flappy Bird game, I have also implemented two models using the Neataptic.js algorithm. Neataptic.js is a JavaScript library for neuro-evolution, allowing for the creation and training of neural networks.

### First Model

The first model I created using Neataptic.js is designed to learn and play the Flappy Bird game. This model uses neuro-evolution to train a neural network to control the bird's movements in the game. The model learns from its interactions with the game environment, gradually improving its performance over time.

### Second Model

The second model I created using Neataptic.js is focused on a different task or problem. Depending on your project goals, you can tailor this model to suit various tasks such as image recognition, text analysis, or prediction tasks.

Both models demonstrate the capabilities of Neataptic.js in training neural networks for different applications.

## Conclusion

Overall, the Flappy Bird game and the Neataptic.js models showcase the potential of JavaScript and neural networks in game development and machine learning tasks. These projects represent an exciting intersection of technology and creativity, opening up possibilities for further exploration and innovation.
